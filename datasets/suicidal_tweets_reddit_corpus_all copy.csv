"Everything and nothing. I returned a few days ago from a transformative experience. I went with a great friend to SAT2. And I say transformative because it changed my perception of seeing my life. I learned about my personality, my demons and my masks. Apart from knowing the family mandates to choose a partner, in these moments I realize that much of the happiness and pain that I have had has been a fantasy. An illusion. The pain I thought I was feeling was just pure neurosis. Seeing demons where there were none and I chose my personal hell with demons included. My demons: fear of pain, demand, denial, greed and especially abandonment and rejection. All this dressed with a mask of falsehood. It was very hard to see that falsehood sells me the idea that people will accept me and love me. When in reality it pays me with pain and fear. I thought he was fearful, insecure, shy and weak. I realize that if I put my mind to it, I am all this and everything else that may be as defects. They have helped me to live in my hell, to avoid realizing myself and being the victim of my own mask. People don't see that part, as I am many more things than that. I am everything and nothing. And I can experiment in being everything and nothing at the same time. I am authentic, level-headed, friendly, understanding, compassionate, loving, caring, caring, honest, sober, humble and happy. I know how to dance, something that scared me very much since people I loved very much told me that I danced ridiculously and clumsily. It is not like this. If I put my mind to it, I can be this and all of the above. I had moments of great pain, shame, confusion, lethargy, denial, judgment, and exhaustion. But there is no way to reach happiness if it is not through the pain and acceptance of what is there. Not what I think there is, or what I wish there was. I went through envy, spiritual gluttony, lust, vanity, fear, anger, pride, laziness, and personal greed. I have a very 5 side that makes me lock myself in my low-energy castle so I don't have to leave there. Knowing everything for a possible personal catastrophe. And I withdraw, isolate myself and do not trust. Distrust and fear took over much of my life. Anger and rage served me to attack and at the same time defend myself from possible betrayal, disloyalty and lies."| No risk

"My false 3 side like a 3 peso bill. Self-deception, showing a face that is not, seeing that what I think I am does not exist and that behind that there is a lot of crap. My lonely and wounded inner child created that fantasy to draw strength from where there was none. I don't need it anymore. I see all the possibilities of being. Realize that I can be everything. And unidentify myself and then be nothing and open all possibilities again. I've been holding on to a lot of the things that I create my personality for. My ego. My thousand masks with demons included ready to give a projection of my wishes and fears. I touched happiness. I realize that I am happy. That it is only enough to take parts of myself and the possibilities that life offers as defects or qualities to face life. I would not even say that there are defects and qualities but rather characteristics. Why not feel pride when I feel bad inside and people attack me? Why not feel envy if it helps me to compare myself and get ahead? Why not be vain if it prevents me from leaving? Many of them are low passions, or also personal defenses. Virtues such as serenity, humility, authenticity, equanimity, courage, courage, serenity, innocence and action help me to transcend myself. Get ahead. Be better. Now I am neither better nor worse than anyone. I'm nothing. I am everything. Fear blurs on the canvas of life. And I, like brushstrokes on the canvas, take on different shades. The work is not finished until it is finished. As simple as that. I would love to realize that work, the brushstrokes and the emotion that feeling in balance with what this great work gives me gives me. And what I love most of all ... That I have wonderful people like my family and friends who have been there. That they are still there and that at the end of the day they show me how great they are, and that they let me be the way I want to be.

"Fear, guilt and other nonsense. I still have the words of my mother-in-law echoing in my head: ""Take advantage now that you can"", ""You will not see each other as often as before"", ""You will not be able to come every weekend"" and a loooong and so on. In case she didn't remember, there she is and with each reminder of her, a cramp in my belly that reminds me of going down to planet Earth when I'm with him. It's true ... Maybe I'm being a bit harsh with her, but someone had to pay for it, even if it was on her blog, right? Well no, really, but this is the most cowardly way I have to combat the feeling of guilt and fear that is invading me at this very moment. Fear because the moment when we have to move even further miles away, in which more days will go by without seeing each other, is getting closer and closer and the truth is, I am panicky as I can manage to take it ... But I will take it the best That I can, because ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" (or so they say), but if it takes me forever to see it for five days, how long will a month take me? Feeling of guilt because in this adventure, I will accompany him in the distance (at least, for now). I will not have the great luck to share this dream side by side with him because the obligation also demands me. And I do not know if it is because I have heard too many opinions about it or because at this very moment, I am not in a lot of courage but I feel enormously selfish to stay here, in my city, continuing with my life. Yes, I know, what I just said is silly, but I know so many cases contrary to mine that it seems that the right thing to do is to abandon all my dreams to go after my man to fulfill his. I do not judge those who left absolutely everything for them, I think that to a greater or lesser degree, we all end up abandoning something, but I do not want them to judge me for wanting to continue with my dreams, while my hero, in the distance, continues with theirs. I don't think I love him less, in fact maybe I love him even more than many people, when reading these lines, can imagine, since I want to fulfill myself as a person, and then fulfill myself as a couple, just as he is doing. And with this I am not writing a text justifying my actions since it is not necessary, it is simply a statement of the facts of why I should not feel guilty. Worst of all, these thoughts always come up in his absence and I try, unwise, to solve them over the phone. And yes, I know it is not the best option but I can't find another way because, when we are together, I forget all these kinds of thoughts. I stare at him, trying to remember everything I wanted to say to him but, when he looks back at me, they end up completely erased, for later, when he leaves again, they reappear in my mind like stabbing daggers."| No risk
"Diary of a God. Today that I am God, a Christ and a united Antichrist, I understand the rupture between the kingdom of God and God, between a Christianity that preaches Christ as the redeemer which leads us to the father and a being Christ revealing the being, the coincidence of all opposites, the fundamental unity in love, the gospel is that the kingdom is on earth, this alters absolutely everything, while seeking God through the redemption of Christ is the total forgetfulness of the kingdom, nothing changes in existence the kingdom stays far away in heaven. My serious problem is that in Jesus Christ, people were cured, reconciled with God, found love and wisdom, on the other hand, I who have chosen the wrong path, I see that when people approach me they get sick, get confused, become unreconciled and I suffer terribly impotence because I cannot love them or even hate them, but I have decided to be God and I must carry it with dignity, until the Father frees me from this nightmare and allows me to rest. Yesterday an Indian approached me and told me that he could kill God and become a God like me, his pretense made me so angry and in the end I could not avoid an explosion of compassion, because everyone around me wanted to lynch him so I answered him You can never kill God, you cannot kill something that is not alive in you.

I have chosen a verb and it has been ""to return"", I have made a wish and it was for you to do it.

I have forged ties with rust and moisture, and with the coldest metal, but none of them have taught me anything that I did not already know before. The wind has moved the leaves of the city, and the heat has dried up the sources. Also your eyes, also my mouth.

You have never once said "" I wish you were - "" but deep down, I know you would have sort off wanted me to become like that. I'm so sorry for being rude and pushing you away. [...] Both of you have taught me so much but the honest truth is, [...] I wanted to sing. I could never tell you the truth because dad told me that I had a terrible voice and I sounded like a frog. You had hurt me deeply and I was left with a painful scar that prevented me from singing in front of people, after what you said I had a mental block in my head [...] But I managed to stop myself and I got over my fear. For the past 3 years, I have been singing when no one was at home and I practised very hard, I realised then that it was my passion and I found enjoyment in doing it even after singing for 6 hours straight. [...] I was so hopeful that one day I could sing for you two and you would be proud of me.I never once stopped practising and I have been trying to tell you for a while. When I said I wanted a recording mic for my guitar, I really meant I wanted a recording mic for singing. When I said I wanted to grow up and do something in the music industry, I meant that I wanted to sing, not a guitarist. But each time, you had indirectly shot me down, unintentionally, both of you had been discouraging me when you critised the people on TV, or when you called a singer I loved talentless. It hurt me the most when mom told me that I wasn't doing anything to achieve my dreams, because I rarely practised the guitar. I was really hurt back then and I wanted to scream, everything I worked hard secretly for was difficult, and you were saying that I was being lazy. But even deeper inside, I could never blame the both of you, I was a coward, I never told you what I wanted but expected you to get it.
Most nights, I spent crying, wishing that some other son, a better one would replace me and make you proud. [ ...] I had half wished I was a girl, I loved girl clothes, and had what you called "" girly hobbies "" , I'm sorry I never loved sports or "" boy "" stuff. I felt so bad about feeling this way that I killed a part of me. I stopped doing girly things, pretended to be a "" manly "" person [...]  I started cutting words like "" Die, Loser, Useless, Fag "" all over my thighs, because those things were what I were. Those scars on my legs aren't from my falling into a drain or "" cellulite "" as dad mentioned once, but are scars from myself cutting.
Everything about me had been a mistake and the worst part, mom and dad, is that I'm not straight. I'm gay, homosexual. I'm not sure what went wrong but I always knew, even as a kid. I'm so sorry about it, [...] I had a weird surge of confidence and I had a plan to come out, I would tell both of you and I would then put it on Facebook announcing it. That moment was a moment of freedom, for once I actually felt unnaturally happy. [...] At home, I act different, I act conservative, but everyone else sees a different me, outside, I become gay, a sassy, hip swaying, finger snapping fag. I was okay with it when I was young but then I started to see the judging eyes, [...] I would become straight. I bottled up every ounce of gayness I had and I became dull and monotonous. I had forced myself to look at girls, forced myself to like them but it didn't work. [...] I felt dead inside. Everything I really was. Effeminate, Homosexual, Singer. I hid from you. After a while, I couldn't trust people any longer and I became distant from everything. I started hating my friends and I couldn't even leave the house without feeling like I wanted to crumple in a heap so people wouldn't see me. [...]. At the time I'm writing this, I am feeling exhausted and I have exams tomorrow. I'm stressed, tired and honestly I feel like you don't understand me enough. [...]
I did my best to listen when either of you ranted about each other and I always did everything to help you whether it be finding something or giving you a massage. [...]. Your son has been nothing short of a failure and a pussy. [...]. I still love you greatly.

If you do too, please move on too, spend my college money on a holiday you always wanted to go, spend some time with each other, get closer to your friends.Make my funeral short and cheap, burn me and throw me into the ocean, at least I'll feel like I did something really cool for once.
I'm so sorry you had to find my body, I'm so sorry you have to cry, I'm so so sorry about everything, the times I made you feel bad, the times I went agaisnt you. Thank you for bringing me up. The last 16 years have been fun despite what I said and I loved all the things we did together.Thank you, goodbye mummy and daddy."| Risk

I think its important for the MRM to adopt and use this word more frequently, particularly when engaging with feminists. We readily use ""Misandry"" to describe the attitudes in society towards men, but in doing so we tend to ignore the root cause of that misandry, which is fear. Feminists have done a bang up job at making men into monsters, and its bred generations of women (and even some men) that look at (other) men with unnecessary paranoia. For this reason, I think adding androphobia more to our vocabulary will help move the dialogue forward, by not focusing on the hatred of men, but the cause of that hatred."""| No risk

"Lessons from Four Decades of Depression
My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time."| Risk
"Anyone else feel like commiting suicide out of spite?
Because I do. Every single time my family tells me to ""snap out of my depression"" and ""go back to being the person you used to be"" I feel like killing myself in front of them.

"I’m a single mother and I want to kill myself.
I had my daughter at 19. Her father died from cancer when she was 10 months old. I fell into deep depression and wanted to commit suicide. But I convinced myself to keep living until my daughter turned 18. I had nothing at the time, but I was determined to give her the best life until then.

I am now 33. And in those 14 years, I worked my ass off. I was working 2 jobs, while also attending college. I eventually graduated and landed a job that pay well. After a few years I saved up enough money to buy a house. I even put money aside for her college fund. So by the time she turn 18, I would have saved enough money for her to attend a University. Despite all the struggles and barriers I faced, I finally felt content. All my hard work was finally paying off. I started to feel like life was worth living. The thoughts of committing suicide after she turned 18 began to fade.

But now that feeling of self worth is gone and depression has fully taken over again. Everything changed when my daughter turned 14. I found out that she has been sneaking out, having sex, and has been using DXM to get high. My daughter said that she became this way because...of me. Because I was too strict on her with her grades and chores. And that she just wanted to be free. I admit that I do yell at her when she slips up, and that I can be very intense. But I have never lay a hand on her. I grew up in an abusive household, so I told myself I will never hurt her the same way my parents hurt me. I told myself I will raise her the best way that I can. But I failed. I failed as her mother and I was wrong thinking I deserved to live.

I tried putting my daughter in therapy in attempt to help her. She told me she wanted to change. But it was all lies. I still found pills in her room. I even found out that she has a “trap phone”, a secret cellphone she bought from a friend with her birthday money. And she was still sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with boys to have sex. I feel like I completely lost her and she would be happier if I was dead. I feel useless. I feel unnecessary. I feel like I’m not good enough to be her mom. My heart hurts so much. I’m just not strong enough to handle this. I just want this all to end."| Risk

"What are you realistically supposed to do? I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.
**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you."| Risk

"It is Likely that I’ll lose my Husband to suicide.
We’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. He attempted suicide once, before we met. I should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. He’s been honest since we met about his mental health and I knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but I was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. 
Fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) He wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. We’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. This Past Fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. He was really down for a few months.  Finally we tried a Ketamine infusion series which worked really well. But slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. We tried a Ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.
He told me last night that he’s done fighting. Life is just too hard. 
I felt like in the fall I had started preparing myself for the fact that I might lose him. I was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. But right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. 
No one else really knows the extent of His depression. I feel selfish wanting him to stay, because I know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. However the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and I have to think about those things because I will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their Dad. And I cannot imagine life without my soul mate. I don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I feel so scared and alone.

** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. This is my first post and first I thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how I was feeling. 

I know it sounds like I’m giving up, but truly I will fight with him as long as he wants. He knows this. He also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. Depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (In my opinion) 

So I’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. 

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. Working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. He’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! 

And we have a beautiful family. We have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. They know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. My kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. 

And for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know I hear you. Keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but I am proof, it’s possible."| Risk
"""Killing yourself is SELFISH""
You might've heard this when mentioning suicide to somebody, or talking about it. Maybe you even said it to someone else if you're not suicidal. I'll make this clear, IT'S FUCKING RUDE! Seriously, what is insulting a suicidal person gonna do? I'll tell you what it won't do, it won't pull them away from the edge. I had a friend who was at the bottom point, where they could hardly do anything, and they spent 2 months in a hospital due to brain damage from asphyxiation, and even longer in a different hospital while they took medicine and rehabilitation courses. I asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it, and they said ""I kept hearing how selfish I was being, and I hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more. I only pulled back when they stopped saying that, (a doctor) told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue, and I felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did, and he knew it wasn't selfishness to me...""

"Why is it so fucking difficult to die?
I never wanted to exist. I want to die. There isn't anything in this world that's going to change my mind. I don't want to get better. My mental and physical illness might actually be curable but I don't want to get better. I never enjoyed life and the only reason I am alive is simply due to my parents' selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me. I never asked to be born and no, life isn't a 'gift'. Life is pain, misery and dread.

I am too much of a coward man. I tried to take my life once but didn't do any research on my method so obviously, as you can see, I failed tremendously. I took a bunch of Xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping they'll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing...a simple google search would've saved me some time, because you need HUGE amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die...yet I went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it.

I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit. I wish I had the courage to attempt it again, in a different way, but I'm too much of a pussy. That failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that I'm such a failure that I can't even kill myself. I've been researching suicide methods ever since, but I just can't bring myself to do it, yet I somehow will. I need to.

&nbsp;

Looked up every single suicide method. Most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable. Others, will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and I just don't have the guts to go for it. I am a huge coward. Who knows, maybe I'm just not ready to kill myself yet, as much as I want it??? Possibly.

Jumping in front of a train? Nope, there's a chance of living through it and suffering 100 times more. Jumping off a building? Literally same. If you're unlucky, you can jump off a skyscraper and survive (there's an actual story of some dude who fell off a 47-floor building and survived). Shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since I live in a shithole of a country in Eastern Europe, it's nearly impossible for me to get a gun. I'm currently doing some research on hanging since it's the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and I've read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly. But if you miscalculate, you will either end up decapitated or you'll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you 15 minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging. Overdosing on pills? I can't think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you.

So what am I left with? Oh yes, opiates. Good old heroin. There's stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ODs and said that it was absolute bliss. You just go in a deep sleep and (hopefully) don't wake up. No hallucinations or paranoia or shit that you'd experience with other types of drugs. Just peace. 


&nbsp;

So I started to look for a heroin plug in my area. It's not easy living in a small city because you're out of luck. At some point, I was so desperate that I stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and I just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area. I was met with surprised reactions, some were weirded out, some were concerned. Luckily, I'm not in prison so lucky me I guess, would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something. Long story short, I couldn't find a dealer for the love of me. So here I am, browsing the darknet.

It took me a few weeks to learn the ropes. There's special software like Tails, Tor, PGP/Kleopatra, and the bitcoin wallet of choice. Still, no one will actually guarantee that you don't get scammed. I'm still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that I won't get in trouble. It fucking sucks. I just want to die and I can't understand all the unnecessary struggle I need to undergo. I wish it were as simple as going to the hospital, signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot. Yet, only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows. I didn't choose to come into this life so why am I forced to stay?

I can't find anyone who is willing to fucking help. I have tried reaching out online, both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback I've received was from people who ""want me to get better"". Why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life? Why does everyone care about a random stranger's death so much? I don't want to live, is it a crime to hate life? It certainly seems so.

&nbsp;

There's so much stuff I'm going to risk. I thing I have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback. I'm going to order from him as soon as I figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency. I might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door, who knows? Maybe my pack will get seized. I might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws. Even if I DO get my hands on heroin, I know nothing about it. I don't know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation. Can you freaking believe it? You're trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm. Amazing. I know nothing about how to cook the heroin, how to shoot it up and how much to take. I know nothing about the purity of heroin and I might end up with some shit grade heroin that isn't going to kill me anyway. There's no fucking way to die peacefully. But anyway, I'll go through this. Not sure why I even wrote this, just needed to vent I guess.

Wish me luck."| Not defined
"Monday again tomorrow. Another week of anxiety and pain.
Everyday on the way home from work I wish I was dead. Like I'd rather die than deal with the stress and anxiety of having to work and live in today's society. I would rather die than have to attend meetings, work, and feel incompetent for the rest of my life. I feel so stupid and inferior to everyone, like I can't even remember basic things and have to ask questions all the time.

"My wife's boyfriend told me to kill myself
My wife left me in September after 8 years of marriage. This last Saturday, I received a phone call from my wife's number. When I picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. The first question he asked was why I hadn't already killed myself. I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. Before I was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day. When I came to, I was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck, one pumping the contents of my stomach out, while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream. After spending 48 hours in the ICU, I'm home. I have an appointment on the 22nd of November with a therapist and a doctor, but I don't think that's soon enough. I'm scared. And ashamed. And I feel even more alone. I miss my wife and my children dearly. Which makes this so difficult to comprehend. I still can't believe that someone could say that to another human being. It cut deeper than any wound I could possibly imagine."| Risk
"My brother killed himself and I am about to do the same thing
This is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it. 

Please help me

Edit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. I put the knife away and I will try to sleep for a bit.

Thanks to each and every single one of you

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold.
I also want to thank every person that has offered me to talk with them, I really appreciate it.

Im sorry for bothering you guys

Edit 3: its bad. I had a panic attack and cut myself. 

Edit 4: a day since posting. Im still alive but not in a good state

Edit 5: still alive, my parents will be home tomorrow I will talk to them about therapy 

Edit 6: This is the final edit. I tried to kill myself.
I cut myself pretty bad and almost died. im okay now and im going to therapy. Thanks for the support."| Risk
"Zero motivation to live but zero motivation to die. Just kinda want to not exist but not die at the same time?
I dont know if that makes sense. Feeling massively depressed for most of my life growing up and I feel like even if I get over depression I won't get over trauma I experienced which sorta still creeps up on me. At times I wish i could disappear cause I feel it wouldn't matter, but I can't make myself do it cause i know itd hurt people even if I tell myself they wouldn't bother. 


I get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which I guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow?

The only time I feel something genuinely is when I hurt myself but it leaves my face bruised and its hard to make up excuses when people ask but sometimes I wish someone would ask about it genuinely because its draining feeling this disconnected from the world and myself and im too afraid to find help so it just eats away at me"| Risk
"Is anyone else not able to cry?
A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't bottle up or hide my emotions, because that would only makes things worse, and that I should express what I'm feeling. But the problem is I have nothing to express or bottle up, I don't feel anything. Nothing makes me happy or excited anymore, although I've gotten pretty good at faking it so people around me don't realize just how dead I am inside. I don't feel sad ever either. Things happen that should make me sad or any other emotion but there's nothing there. I feel like I should feel something, but I don't. I'm just so desensitized to it all I just don't care anymore. And I know I should cry, and Ive tried, but I can't. Nothing happens. I'm just there, as dead as ever with no tears or emotions or anything. At night, when I lay awake, im just blank. I just want to feel something again even if its sadness because I can't keep going feeling so empty inside."| Not defined
"I lied to my therapist, I’m just done, and at this point I don’t think I can be talked out of it, you can’t save people that don’t want to be saved. I just want someone to know.
I don’t think anyone will read this, but if you do, thanks. Throwaway account for privacy. 

I know people will think I’m posting this because I still have some shred of hope or some part of me wants to live, but that’s not it, like I said, I don’t think anyone can talk me out of it now, I just want someone to know, everyone on this sub is completely disconnected from me personally, and that makes me feel better. 
I’m young, 17, and I understand there’s so many years that I could have, I just don’t want them. I’ve contemplated suicide a few times over the years, I’m sure everyone has, but it was always a fleeting thought, now it’s constant. 
I just lost a parent, I’m in so much pain, not just mental, mostly physical actually. I live with health conditions that leave me in pain every second of every day, no matter what I do. The odd thing is, I’m not depressed, I deal with crippling anxiety, but not so much depression. 
I’ve been in therapy for a couple years now, she’s an amazing therapist, I genuinely couldn’t ask for anything more, she has tried very hard. The only time I’ve ever admitted wanting to die is last week, I regretted saying it immediately, she asked a couple questions, I answered honestly but told her I didn’t want to say anything else as I was scared she would tell my mother and I would be committed. She said she didn’t have to break confidentiality unless she suspected I was a danger to myself, doing things like stockpiling, planning etc. 
so obviously I didn’t admit that I had been doing those things, because I don’t want to be stopped. 
I honestly don’t understand why we try so hard to save people that don’t want to be saved. If someone wants to die, and they are so determined that they will do whatever it takes to make it happen, let them do it. At least they’d be able to go out with some shred of dignity. I’ve set a date to do it multiple times, and then backed out at the last minute, but tonight’s the night, I’m done backing out. I was scared this morning, and then counted how much I had stockpiled and was suddenly so relieved and for the first time in a while, felt excited. I can’t wait to go to sleep and not have to wake up resentful that I’m waking up. 
I feel bad that my family will have to find me, but not bad enough that I’m not going to do it. 
I don’t really want to die, but I don’t want to live in this pain either. I’ve weighed the pros and cons, and dying just outweighs living for me. 
Thank you for reading, I hope everyone else on here can find peace with whatever decision they make."| Risk

I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype. Medication works for me only some of the time, and the side effects make it so that even when I am sane I am trapped in a state of joyless sedated apathy.

I am 25 and have been sick for over 10 years now - how am I supposed to keep going for another 40 years like this, poor, barely able to work, still surrounded by hallucinations on the regular because the horrible medications don't even work properly on me. If I take my meds, life becomes a chore that offers no relief. If I don't take my meds, I have crazy states of mania and hallucinations and end up jobless and alone.

"I'm actually excited about the corona virus and hope it kills me or changes life overall for the human race so my life isnt so fucking meaningless all the time.
I know no one here really cares about this and that's not a surprise. In today's society, everyone is so fucking selfish. Seriously, everyone either cares about money or clout or both. I don't have either of those and I do envy those who are spoiled. My life isn't bad at all and in fact I have many more advantages than most people my age, but I still feel like theres no purpose. I get a degree from university. So what? then I have to work a boring ass fucking office job for years 8 hours a day only having some time on the weekends for a few hours? What is the fucking point. I swear it feels like a fucking prision. The only thing I semi enjoy is gaming but you can't make a career out of it today. and yes, I KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS NOT PROBABLE.  so don't give me that shit about ""just try"" like fuck off. 

Overall I honestly feel like theres no purpose in life. Like when thinking about killing myself I try to remember to before I was born and what it was like and I realize I can't remember anything because I didn't exist. It was like a void. The same will happen when I kill myself. no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans can't even comphrend.

I don't know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me, they have goals and are doing stuff. I have no goals. I have no ambitions and don't care what anyone else thinks. One day I will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy. fml.

"As of 1 hour ago, literally all my friends are dead.
All left me in 2016.

 My best friend was the first to go. She started doing heroin against my warnings. A week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. I remember the last text I got from her... 

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. 

This year has been emotional torment. I said I couldn't handle any more losses. Then an hour ago, I get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer... I can't do this anymore. I'm sick to my stomach. I'm all alone. I have literally no one to talk to... all the people I could find comfort in are gone...

"There was a Double Murder/Suicide in My Family Last Night. TRIGGER WARNING.
⚠️ Trigger Warning ⚠️ 
Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.

I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.

Now comes the awfulness.

Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

- - - - - 

“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.

And then this.

Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.

That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.

That’s when things got worse. 

Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.

Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. 

The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.

Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. 

Just 5 minutes.

The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. 

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

My little brother is an absolute mess. The news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened, swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment. Horrible sick people. Someone said something about publishing this in the paper, and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy. Everyone is hysterical. 

The police have already ruled it a Murder/Suicide. 

My little brother Mike is a mess, my mom is a mess, and I’m trying so hard to be strong. Mike can’t understand why his father would do that. Why he’d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself....taking the cowards way out. The suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body. 

Luckily, Mike’s older brother Bill, the girlfriend Megan, and little Eli is okay. But we are all damaged. How will anything ever be okay again? 

This is SENSELESS.

I’ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family. Now I’m collapsed at my fiancé’s, just taking it all in while he holds me tight. I’ve already put an email in to my therapist. Sorry about the crappy writing, and if this is difficult to understand; it’s a complicated situation and I’m barely functioning.

That's it. I feel I'm just too lazy for life. I have lost motivation and interest in everything. I'm not looking forward for future at all and I don't enjoy living.

I don't know what is so wrong with me. I force myself to do things I have to do, exercise on regular basis, although all I want to do is just sleep or lock myself in a room without seeing anyone. But even I force myself, motivation still doesn't come. It's like I have lost interest in life.

I'm very tired of putting on a mask to hide how disfunctional I actually am. I need to constantly pretend that I care and I'm interested in everything, or that I'm present while I'm doing something when my mind just can't stop imagining about death every single moment. 

I don't think I will be able to do suicide because my parents would be too traumatized by it, but I honestly don't know how long I can keep going and I welcome death, or if there was a dangerous situation that could lead me to death, I probably won't escape.

"Goodbye I guess <3
Hey Reddit,

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying. Anyways, I feel like on Reddit it's hard to picture users as actual people so I'll set the scene slightly. Hey, I'm Scarlett and I'm currently living in the UK. I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it. 

Goodbye for now,

"Attempted suicide two years ago. Just got Facebook timeline and saw something...
I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. 

When I go home I’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help I’ve been procrastinating on getting. I’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight. 

The timing of everything that happened tonight wasn’t a coincidence at all. "| Risk
"The biggest lie I have ever been told was that you should treat others the way you’d want to be treated.
People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who aren’t good to me. The funny part is after it’s all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren’t in that situation. I just don’t care enough to live in a world that doesn’t care about me."| No risk;No risk
"Does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal?
I feel like I could end it all at any second and get some relief. But I also go through the motions of life like I'm planning to live for so much longer. I go to class for the most part, eat food, try to look groomed on the outside. In a way, I feel like people can't take me seriously. All my so called friends just look at me like there's nothing wrong with me. Even though I tell them things, it's like the end of the day I look okay on paper, so I must be okay. My parents know I feel like this but they already have my life planned out and I feel trapped. It's been a constant trend in my life where even if I tell people I'm struggling, no one believes me. I think that's part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help. I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way 

Edit: I'm honestly surprised at how much attention this has gotten. I just want you all to know that your feelings and thoughts are valid no matter what and should be treated as such. There's still a lot of stigma about mental health in general but I fully believe everyone is entitled to treatment and a therapist who will sympathetically listen to their problems no matter what. None of you deserve anything less than that. I've tried my best to respond to all the people who responded but my inbox is always open to messages if anyone wants to say anything. Thank you guys so much for making me feel like this isn't so abnormal"| Not defined
"Ever jump to the thought of suicide over minor inconveniences?
I can’t be the only one I’m sure. Any minor inconvenience; a mistake I made, getting yelled at by parents, beating myself up over things that are out of my control even.

My mind just automatically goes to death in those cases. I guess I’ve gotten so used to considering it an option and thinking about it multiples times a day, that when any inconvenience happens, my mind jumps to “you should kill yourself” right away. 

Thing is, when I try to talk to, say, my best friend about it, he listens and then responds with “how can you think these things?” I’m made to feel as though it’s my fault for jumping to the idea of death so easily and thinking the things I do.

 I feel invalidated when I talk about those thoughts to him, especially if the reason is something small. I usually also get shut down immediately with “that’s not you that’s thinking these things, it’s the thoughts” or “that’s not what you want”, or better yet, “that’s dumb/stupid.”

Edit: Maybe it’s because the idea of suicide brings me peace and calms me down in overwhelming situations. I know that if I kill myself, all my problems will go away and I won’t have to be worried about anything anymore. It’s probably weird to say the idea of killing myself makes me happy or brings me peace but it literally does somehow."| Risk
"i don't think life sucks, i just genuinely believe living isn't for everyone
grew up in a household with parents passively hating eachother for the past 12 years openly in front of me and my siblings but won't divorce because they can't do well financially on their own. would often talk bad about the other to us and would use us to communicate when they wouldnt want to talk to eachother. 

did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities I used to love and harmed myself. 

started having suicidal thoughts and a year after I attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.

was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend. i've been so happy with him these past months. but with him only. i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before, except when i was spending time with him. 

i don't have any goals in life anymore, i can't go to college and i work minimum wage. also, i'm really sensitive about what's going on in the world and it makes me loose hope for humanity. 

i don't think life sucks, i genuinely just believe living isn't for everyone. some people are able to make the most of it and find happiness, but some just don't have the right mentally and tools and it should be okay for them to leave if that's what makes them happy. 

it hurts to have someone you love die, i understand that, but what good does it make to try and keep someone who isn't happy and won't be happy in the future and let them suffer for years to come? wouldn't that hurt? 

also before you guys mention my boyfriend, yeah i love him, but love never really lasts. and at this point, i'm so sensitive that if we ever have a fight or go through a rough time, I would definitely break and kill myself, cause he's pretty much the only thing that still makes me genuinely happy. and i can't imagine how bad it would be if i left that way, i don't want him to blame himself, he doesn't deserve that. i would rather leave when we're still on great terms."| Not defined
"My sister told me to kill myself
My sister and I used to be best friends. But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a ""grudge"" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, ""I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself.""

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, ""What? What did you just say?""

""I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already.""

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was ""nice"", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.

"3 weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows
November 23, 2019 I attempted suicide. I have not told anyone, or very little people. I tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress. After the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted.... I haven't really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot. The work day after my suicide attempt was different, I noticed people actually seemed to care. Or, i saw some accomplishment in myself.

"Not expecting much from here. Even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless
I just need to vent.

I'm a single gay man in my late 30's. Seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. Been there, done that. Have a couple of college degrees. I don't drink or do drugs.

I always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. I found myself working with autistic children and public service which I liked, but it's not a stable job. I had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). Realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, I quickly landed a job in corporate America.

Then I was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the DA, I got five years probation and two suspended sentence. I was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. A year into probation, I got violated for having a bullet. Ironically, I had purchased a gun in case I was facing serious time. So I went to prison for two years. It was awful. There was nothing rehabilitative about it. While everyone talked about getting high once they got out, I talked about getting a job.

I was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. I found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. A year later, it went out of business. I said ""fuck it"" and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. It worked. I landed the highest-paying job I ever got. With health insurance too. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

Lately I had been feeling suicidal. Burned out. Anxious. Overwhelmed. The one thing that kept me going was my job. It took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).

Then I got fired today.

Not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. It's beyond me how they found out. I think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. I was a good worker. I left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. I can't do this again. It's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. That's a lie. Been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. It had to be up to me.

To keep on trying to make it is senseless. It's insanity.

I called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. He was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. I wasn't expecting anything.

I think he understood. Killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.

I've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. I thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told I have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. I'd rather die and leave my savings to her. I feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).

There is this part of me that fears death less. What I fear is my future. At least death is inevitable.

Again, not expecting anything life changing on here. The next few days will be brutal. I have crossed a point of no return today.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass, binge eating and sleeping. I looked in the mirror and look like shit. My apartment is a wreck. I thought to myself what my next step is and all of them were ""tying"" up loose ends. It's just too complicated, high-risk low-reward, expensive, much pressure, etc. to move on with life. It takes up too much of my life and I was already dealing with too much and I don't have the energy to do it anymore. People like me who choose life under these circumstances end up going back to prison and/or on the streets. I'd rather die."| Risk
"I tried to ask my family for help, and their answer is ""God"".
Im from a third world country, and my entire family is very religious, I'm not. 

While I respect their choice to belive in something, they dont respect mine. They think that depression is a joke, that it's just an excuse for ""lazy"" people. I tried to explain to them how the human body works, but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them.

Im alone. Im 20, I dont have a job, I dont have friends, and the only joy that I have in this world is to talk with my ""online friends"" and that is starting to fade away. I never met my mother and my father ( the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole ) hanged himself 2 years ago, and now I have to hear things like ""he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find God"".

"Why is suicide looked down upon but mental health is often overlooked during the entire buildup?
What's the point of going on when you lost everything? No family anymore, no gf anymore, no joy in life anymore, no pursuit of knowledge, due to depression confiding you to a bed, no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi-weekly while executives earn 10-100x your salary for your menial work.

I read that Alan Turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during World War 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. His hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. Was he weak? No, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.

We're told suicide is selfish. But if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? Where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?

Nobody wants to hear your problems. If you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. Life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. People will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized. Then you ask yourself am I doing enough, is it worth bringing up, or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made?"| Risk

2018 has been absolutely horrible for me. I feel like I've ruined every connection to people I had. It feels like everyone hates me.

I cry every day multiple times but most of the time it's for no reason at all or it's because my life is just so sad. I can barely function at work. I've been struggling with food for the last few months where I can't seem to eat normally. It's either eat way too much or I go at least a day without eating.

"I was wrong
I hate when people say to think of how much pain you'll cause others. They'll get over it, I always think. I'm just a burden anyway. They'll be sad for awhile, but better off in the long run.

Yesterday I intended to kill myself. My ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. When my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. She was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but I could feel her whole body shaking.

She sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. Just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. But even half an hour later I could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. She was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. Later, when I went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. It was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.

I knew she would be sad, but I still underestimated how much she cared. I don't know if I'll ever forget that feeling. I don't think I should.

I wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like I do. I was wrong. You might be too. There are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when I thought they did. There's at least one who cares a whole lot more than I gave her credit for. "| Risk

"Dad's friends raped me.
I feel paralyzed. I barely had enough energy to open up the computer. I don’t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. I’d been in the shower for almost an hour and I just can’t get it out. It’s crippling me and I’m helpless. I have no one else to tell this and I just want to kill myself.

I feel so much hate and anger but I can’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. I hate you so much for letting them do this to me. I hate you so much for doing absolutely *nothing* while they raped me. Is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? None of this would’ve happened if mom was still here. She would’ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.

You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That’s how much I love you. Do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you’d do for me? You only had to show a little of it dad. You only had to stay sober.

"Cops and medics broke in my apartment
I have been suicidal for a long time now, but lately it's getting worse. So i was just chilling at home like i usually do. It was just those days where u want to be alone and don't want to have anything to do with this world. So i turned my phone off and was just doing my thing. Well after 4 days i was playing some games on steam when i suddenly hear some noise, I threw my headphones off and the next thing i know i have cops and rescue workers standing behind me. It was a shock for sure. I didn't know what to do. I didn't really tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts execpt for one friend who i don't hang with anymore. Well instead of admiting I need help I lied to medics that im doing good and need no help. It was hard. It was one of those days where suicide was on my  mind 24/7. But it's to hard for me to open up. I feel like I don't deserve help I just want to be left alone,forgotten. Turns out my friends called for help. I didn't even know they cared about me , this shit suprised me they care about me. About me. I was crying after for like an hour about this i didn't even realize someone actually cares  but i think i knew this deep inside anyway. But my life isn't going to be better in any way. Still deep in debt, might get evicted in a few days, same problems still exist. I wanted to kill myself for a long time, i had it planned ahead in like 3 months. I just feel bad for people who care about and  i will let them down for a final time. I will kill myself in few months for my birthday. But now i feel even more guilty for hurting people around me. But I can't live like this i don't want to. This world just isn't for me. I don't fit in. I can't anymore just can't. I feel like now it's even harder after what i saw yesterday. People crying worried about me... Nobody really knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts except for one friend who i was really close to before we went seperate ways. It was fcking hard on me man i was so fucked up i had to lie to my family, my friends that im good, and had no intention of killing myself. Lying to someone u really care about and looking them in they eyes it hurt my soul deep down. I had to hold it together i just wanted to fcking let it all out and cry and admit that im not doing good at all. And now it's even harder for me, situation it's the same but harder. I will be gone soon but the pain i will bring with my actions i don't even know how to handle that. After all that happened that day i just cried in my bathroom on the floor all night. It was one of the worst nights i had in my life. Knowing i just lied to everyone about my well-being and at the same time wanting to have someone hold me and tell me it's gonna be alright.

"My sister's suicide this week.
I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

&#x200B;

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

&#x200B;

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

&#x200B;

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

I posted this here, as she posted on this subreddit this month, and I want to help and talk to people who feel this way, because I have felt like this before. I also posted this on Suicide Bereavement. "| No risk

edit: i am still here. my life has took a turn and has changed me. i look at life so much more positive now. if your scrolling deep down into this subreddit right now please read. if you are struggling, or relate to the past me^ please, know that no matter what anyone tells you, you are ENOUGH to stay on this earth. no matter what you go through, or how sad or depressed or suicidal you are right now, give yourself a break for a day, realize that you are only human and that you don’t have to meet ANYONES expectations. go at your own pace, you’re here for a long life, take it slow. things WILL (eventually) get better. go talk to your dogs, your cats, your fish, your mom/dad/sister/brother/grandma/grandpa/cousin/aunt/uncle, ANYONE who brings you a good laugh, and if you don’t have many of those people talk to me.  in conclusion, YOUR MOM WILL BE SAD. so please take into consideration that you’re worth every breathable second in this world. <3"| Risk
"I need help... but I don't know what kind.
I’m just putting this out there because Reddit seems to be the only place I can talk freely.    
    
I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here. I found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any I have felt in years. There are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief I feel. It's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.      
      
Since I'm not really sure what to think and how to react, it has helped so much to read your messages. I will prepare something, some kind of *ongaeshi*, I will post it up soon!     
     
Once again.....    
Thank you for caring about me."| Risk
"I didn't ask to be born, but I'm here and I'm forced to function and work on a world that I objectively hate. What do I do about this?
Obviously, nobody asks to be born into this world. I certainly didn't, but here I am at 24 years old. Simply put, I objectively dislike the world and society. I didn't ask to have to need participate in society and  to work in order to pay for food, shelter, etc., but of course most people will just say I'm lazy for not wanting to work. Can they really just not wrap their heads around that concept? How can I get over this involuntary existence without deep downbeing miserable every second of my life until I die? Again. I DID NOT ask to be a part of this, but since I'm here I have no choice other than to work and he miserable until I die. I feel so stuck and I also feel that I've never actually heard a real answer to these feelings other than ""well duh nobody asks to be born just get over it"". What the fuck do I do with that?"| Risk
"Does anyone else find that the fear of what’s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed?

"My boyfriend killed himself a week ago
And I really want to do the same. It hurts so much to miss him every second of every day. We were a good couple, with so much love for each other. We were each other’s everything. Whenever I had anxiety or was simply sad, the only thing that helped was his hugs and kisses. Now he’s not here anymore, he’s just ashes.

My friends got worried about me and got me committed against my will at a short term mental hospital and I just got out today, 12 days after his death.

I miss him with every fibre and molecule and atom of my being. It’s physically painful, insufferable. I can’t think about anything else.

I tried overdosing on Xanax with alcohol but I didn’t have enough, and when I woke up the next day I was so disappointed. This was before the hospitalisation. During the hospitalisation I was ok, better than now. But I don’t want to go back there, the place was awful.

The only reason I’m not attempting a new OD this very second is that it would kill (figuratively) my parents. Everyone would be sad. And I can’t do that to them. But at the same time, my love is never coming back and he’s all I want. All I need. NEED with every cell in my body. It physically hurts.

I wish I could disappear from their memories and just die and nobody would be sad. Because I can’t take it anymore. The grief is too big, too hard. What can I do to make it okay for everyone?"| Risk
"Valentines day, the perfect day for me to kill myself
I've been stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety-depression-loneliness for over 4 years now. For the past 2 years I've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, I wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day I'm gonna hang myself.

I'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. Losing touch with my only few friends. Been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when I was about 9. I've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. I'm hopeless cause I'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. I'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.

Love only gives me negative feelings. It makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize I'm not good enough. All the stuff I haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. For the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague I have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. Better end it before yet another all time low. I have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal. So hopefully 14/02 will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance.

"This sandwich doesn't taste good.
It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.

Hello, past a year or two I been having a hard time keeping a job. I just ether don’t like the job, the people there, I feel like I’m always doing something wrong, I hate waking up and wasting my whole day there.

I don’t care about money like really I rather live on the streets or just be dead but my parents keep telling me the same stuff over and over, saying how “Everyone hates working” or “what do you expect to do in life, just sit in our house forever doing nothing” or “that’s life for you, man up stop acting like a kid your a adult now”..

going have to work everyday of my life and I have a hard time making it thru one day.. A day feels like for ever, idk everyday it feels like Its my last day.
I just hate living since I can’t function like a normal person for some reason it seems like everyone is able to do everything better then me and I’m just a mistake..

"I understand suicide
I'm starting to understand people who commit suicide. It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things. Maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. Death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level. 

I have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. While those I care about thought I've gotten better, the reality is, I've just gotten better at hiding it. There are nights that I lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. It's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. Nothing good is sustained. Life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. Every bad decision plagues me and losses I've suffered haunt my thoughts. On the rare occasion I attempt to reach out, I know I will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. There is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line. 

Night before last, while lying awake, I realized I understood people who committed suicide. That scared me. I am in a dark place and I have never felt more alone in my life. This is a time where I could have used the most support. At this time I no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. It's taking so much effort and I need to put everything I have left into my children. They have to be my primary focus and I'm just not sure I have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc."| Risk

I don’t want to live out the next 50-60 years of my natural lifespan in pain waiting for the day to come so I just want to take matters into my own hands now and save myself the suffering. I don’t need judged and told to hold on because things “might” improve. My life has had 17 years in it. Plenty of time to live it and know it’s never going to get any better.

"why are people who really want to die not allowed to kill themselves?
i got lucky in life - family, friends, passionate hobbies, relatively good looks - even so, i’ve felt really fucking bad for ages now. i just want to die every day but i feel like it would be really sudden & hurtful to a lot of people.
An aunt of mine told me once that people who commit suicide are selfish & cowardly after i’d told her i was suicidal. i think she meant it as a kind of wake-up call, but that’s not how it came out.

whenever i drink a ton, don’t get out of bed or don’t go to school, my mum also says things like that to me. but jeez, would she rather me be a zombie like this, or just be dead?
people who feel this way are suffering. I’m really in pain. It’s selfish to want to keep me alive for their own emotional benefit without helping, like i don’t have feelings.

I keep begging the police for help and  they seem sympathetic but tell me that they can't do anything since I am not being threatened. I just lost one of my jobs over this and have no idea what I am going to do. There is no justice in the justice system.

I am going broke from legal fees, bills, and unexpected expenses. The job I lost was only part-time but that $400 a month matters. My ex destroyed my credit so I can't even rely on that. My electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and I don't have the money to pay the rest of the bill.

I have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and I moved so I didn't get the bill. My cat is epileptic and takes medication. She has to get bloodwork every year and I don't know how I am going to afford both the old bill and the new one. I'm so fucking useless that I can't even properly take care of my cat.

I have a new boyfriend but I'm having trouble enjoying it. He reached out to play with my hair yesterday and I flinched so obviously that he pulled back. He told me it's okay, he understands, and even apologized to me for scaring me. *He* apologized to *me* like he did something wrong. I'm the one that's so broken that I pull away from kindness. He deserves so much better than what I can offer.

I am exhausted to the bone. I'm averaging 3 hours of sleep a night and it's interrupted by nightmares. Every noise sends me into a panic and I feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on.

My anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere. I can't leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way.

"""99% of people regretted it!""
Please, I planned that overdose for so damn long. Even got myself an alibi! Enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. Legit, when I was passing out, I have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. The first time I attempted, I was fourteen and I was so happy when I passed out and thought it was over. Every time, even.

Can you imagine how angry and disappointed I was this time when I woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so I ""wasn't a danger to myself?"" For nearly three days I was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because I was ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and all those words to describe someone who just REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to die. Three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because I refused medication. It's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, I suppose. Now I'm back out on suicide watch.

I don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that ""for their own good."" Well, I guess it worked in a fucked up way. Now I want to die more than I've ever wanted to, but I'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and I'll be locked up & left to rot tied to the bed again because I've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. Why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? I have NOT reached out for help, I've only tried to die on my own terms, and I get treated like a violent criminal. Do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a ""hospital"" against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?

Why the fuck do people do this to other people? It's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom I thought I had. I really don't want to live, but I'm too scared to try to die. I can't go through that again. Maybe 99&#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years I've never once regretted it. They don't believe me, though. They just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when I'm ""stable."" I'm not a person to them, I'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if I resist, and thrown back out. Nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if I complain because every record tells how ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and ""suicidal"" I am. No rights, no problems.

How is this okay? How is this the world I live in? How can I possibly want to live? Why am I put through all this just for trying to die?"| Risk
"I didn't kill myself thanks to this subreddit. <3 you guys
9 days ago on Saturday, I decided to kill myself. Wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain I would cause to my family and friends. I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.


Much love.

"my mom attempted suicide today
TW: kind of graphic description of suicide attempt 



so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

"Living with suicidal ideation is like having to put killing yourself on the bottom of your checklist for the day and hoping you don’t get everything done
Like, I (F23) WANT to live. I want to be happy and normal (and I know people are like “there is no normal, we all get sad!” But since puberty I have heard voices, pulled out my hair, self harmed, been generally anxious and extremely emotional, and always suicidal). But my therapists and psychiatrists and parents and friends just tell me to make a list. I get overwhelmed easily and my brain immediately goes to “just die”—but they say making a list helps. So I try, and I put it on the bottom of my list everyday. For example, tomorrow:

-breakfast&coffee
-homework
-shower 
-clean
-work
-homework
-commit suicide

And if I get tired at any time, I just go to sleep and start over again. But dying is always at the end of my list. Its worked for me so far. I’m a great procrastinator, so just putting it off until the next day helps me survive. 

I know sometimes it seems death is grabbing you by the nostrils and screaming in your face to just do it, but I’m talking about just day to day life."| Risk

Like the title says. I'm sick of getting up everyday at the crack of dawn to go to a job that pays too little and get my ass chewed for 9 hours straight everyday. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

"My therapist said I had over 5 lives' worth of trauma packed into my 25 years. I don't think the bad times stop. I'm ready to go.
Hi there. My name is Anna. I'm 25f. This post is going to be incoherent, because I can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. I don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, I'm sorry. 

 I've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. 

The one person I told everything too is so tired. I love him very much, but I know caring about me is a burden. He needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things I don't think I can offer with my brain.

I think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that I have. It's just the truth of my life, and why I'm ready for it to be over. 

I was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. I've been kidnapped / sold. I've been a victim in a shooting. I've been forced to watch children die (murdered). I found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. I've been severely stalked. I watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. I've had friends murdered in college. I've been severely beaten. Hungry/starved. Homeless. There's been so much. And I'm so, so tired. 

If anything, I just want boring years where nothing happens, but I don't think that's possible. Everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. People tell me I'm so strong but I feel so weak.  I don't want to fight to live. I don't want to survive anymore. I wouldn't even call this a crisis because I'm just so ready, so calm and numb.

If my guy sees this, I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you needed. I'm sorry I couldn't get better.  Take care of the cats for me. I hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love. 💙💛

"My parents are emotionally abusive and I'm thinking about killing myself
Hello. I'm depressed. I want to say I'm an introvert but I really am not. I love being with people, laughing with people, sharing stories with others, but I'm unable to relate to anyone. I feel alone. I have my family but that's the problem. My parents are the problem. Ever since I was young they were overly protective of me and never allowed me to go out with friends or have sleepovers with our neighbors. This left me with the disability to socialize well. I am now unable to relate with others, I don't know how to talk. I don't know how to form a bond with others. The worst part is my parents don't give me any attention. Every time I talk to them I feel like they're not treating me like I'm a child and I don't deserve to talk to them. Everytime I open up about being lonely they just tell me to ""grow up"" and stop being emotional. I'm already 18. I feel so confused. I feel sad, I cry often. The only things that put a smile on my face are my dogs, video games, and Netflix. Other than that I have nothing, no one. I want to be a strong person and be capable of living without attention from others but I doubt I'm capable of that. I'm very emotional. From the past few months suicide was always on my mind. That's probably because I feel really lonely, and also because I want my parents to emotionally suffer too, because that's what they did to me.

title is some humour because intergalactic laws dont matter right now

i dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone

the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring

I do, and it scares me. I used to feel panicked and anxious when thinking about suicide and, which would end up in a decent crying session.

For a while now however, I just feel calm and relieved when thinking about it. It's nice to feel that there's always a solution available if things go badly wrong, or if I'm too stressed, when all my life I've only heard to just suck it up and keep moving on to fuck things up all over again.

I just want to know if anyone else has had this, because thinking like that scares me. I don't want to end it, I know my family cares about me, and I don't want them to suffer.

"You ever just have everything going for you, but you fuck it all up?
Life was going well for me. High school was a breeze. I got into a good university for engineering. I had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. 

I fucked it all up.

It began with me being lazy in university. I procrastinated many assignments to the point where I ended a quarter with 3 F's. I try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. Still have GPA above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. However, my FAFSA application was declined because of the poor performance. That was the only way I could afford classes as I did not want to go in debt.

I decide to do work and earn money. I got a job at McDonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since I'm introverted. I work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. Thought I'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than I imagined. 

That same year, I had relationship issues. Around the end of February of last year, I found out my gf had cheated. Though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. I decided to forgive her and continue. Fast forward to May 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. I'm too in love, so I decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, I catch her sending nudes to the same guy. I forgive her again. 

December 2018. Same time I quit my job. I'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (I had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). I'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. I'm struggling.

January 2019. 20-year-old Honda begins to die. I'm left without a car for a month. Girlfriend decides to leave me (To be clear, she meant the world to me. She was the only one close to me). I'm heartbroken. In a desperate attempt to save our relationship. I walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. I promise everything...that everything would get better, and I would fix myself and our relationship. I'm rejected. I'm starting to lose it. 

I can't live in this world without her. She was the only one, the only reason I kept going. We talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. It was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. February 2019. The last time we talk.

I have no one to talk to. She was the only one I could talk to about my personal problems. I had no other close friends. My relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. I'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. I begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. I tell them about my break up. ""That sucks,"" they say. That's all I get. I expected as much....

March 2019. Me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. Pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. I could do this.

Since the break up, however, I haven't felt happy at all. I struggle sleeping. Any thought of her would just make me depressed. There's no escape from her. So many things remind me of her. I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. I break down one day and decide to message her. I explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. No response.

2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, I get fired. I hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.

I'm a failure.

Same week, I learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. I learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. IRS stated that I owed $4,000 from 2012. I was 11-years-old then. I didn't work. So I have that to deal with now. On top of that, I owe $2,000 for my car.

Recently, I've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. There goes my chances of ever fixing that again. To add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom I loved to hang out with. Since shes no longer with me, I'm no longer friends with them. They were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.

So now, I'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. I have a history of cutting. I cut so deep freshman year that I have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. I almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but I pussied out. After what happened to me and my ex in May 2018, I tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately I lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).

I could have stayed in university if I had just done my homework. I could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. I could be making money if I wasn't a quitter. I'm worthless. 

I've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay. If I live, I'm only going to live in regret...wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything. I want to die so bad. I'm only 19, but I dont think I'm going to make it to 20."| Risk

I realized it when I was 16, I’m 18 now. There really is no point, you grow up, you get a job, you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it, then you die. It’s really sad because I wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isn’t. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of how sad I know my mom and dad would be.

"I failed
A couple of days ago, I finally decided to end my life. I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

"Emergency: I'm A Suicidal Teen and my family is trying to end my life.
 

.I won't give much context, but I (14M) got into an extremely heated argument with my Dad over my academic future. I remained respectful, **but he started beating me** and he told me how I'm crazy for liking history and video games, and that I'm gonna suffer and die alone and that no one and nothing will ever love me. I started crying, a lot, and was going to kill myself, by jumping of our roof. However, my Dad grabbed me and started beating me, whilst telling me that I wasn't his son anymore. I ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and I used that). **Mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because I ''upsetted her and God by wishing for suicide''

It's been a few hours now, **and I'm extremely suicidal and I will certainly take my life unless I get immediate help from someone. I** have no trusted friends or adults around, and I live in a shitty third world country that doesn't have a good police force (besides they'll sympathise with my parents), and no emergency helplines. My phone has no battery either (im typing om computer), so I have no helpline I can reach out to (I think).

Please anyone, someone, I need some support of any kind. A simple DM, or something else like a helpline. Please, I really don't wanna die, but I feel so useless.

Help me.

"I think the main reason why I don't kill myself is because I don't want my cats to be sad
Title sounds like a joke. It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them. 

I can't kill myself. I've got a job to do."| Risk
"My dog just passed away
I started considering to end it all a little while ago, when im drunk i have the strongest wish to do it

Then, i remember my parents, even if they love me for the sake of social norm, i have those two with me, i couldn’t bare to make them suffer like that, especially my dad, who loves his family the most

Currently (me, 23, my mom, 57, my dad 59) we had a dog, she was so loved and well treated, she was so smart, dad and i loved her like it was my little sister, my dad relied so much on her emotionally

Long story short, she got run over, we got her treated, this morning we found her dead

I already had serious depression, family is already struggling to bind itself, ive got no interest at all with nothing or nobody, i already had fear, about loneliness, about my father, and now i fear even more, i fear that he will age more quickly, that he will not fulfill his obligations, we could lose our house, i fear that he will die soon too, if he dies i swear i kill myself in the moment

I have already lurked and sadly, posted here 

I know i will not kill myself now, so if any of you wasted time reading this rn, please go help more critical people

I just don’t have anyone to tell this, to tell my problems, yo relief what I feel, and just wanted to note this somewhere

Im just convinced more and more and more to the point im 99% sure that i will have myself killed on some point, i just want to die but also im concerned about my dad and i have plenty of fear"| Risk
"Boyfriend's classmate jumped off a 6 story parking garage yesterday
He wrote a note and everything. Nobody knew a thing, he was so successful, athletic, smart, social. He was friends with everyone. All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma. Everyone knows I'm depressed, because I can't help but overshare. I feel like I burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings. And I can't do it.

"I find myself crying more in public spontaneously
It's happened before when I was starting to work years ago but at least I could hold it a bit until finding a place to hide and cry, but now it could happen anywhere. I can barely hold myself together enough to not tear when family visits. Or in the line on the market, or in a restaurant. Yesterday I just started fully crying on the street and obviously people stared at me. 

It's humiliating. And I can't control it.

"I got arrested buying drugs off the darknet that I intended to kill myself with via overdose and now I am facing a felony and 5-8 years in prison. Whats the point in continuing on?
I have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don't know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.

I don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. 

Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don't deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.

Anyways back to earlier this year.  This was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and I had failed again.  I have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this Christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so I spent my very first Christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  Things were going downhill and again I was getting more and more depressed.  I started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure I had food to eat.  At this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because I was too negative.  I felt like I was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  I made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as I had done a few times before and do it right this time.

My package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  I was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  I'm always surprised when I think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  After that I was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  My court date is a month away and I am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.

I have tried everything to get better I have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  I have tried DBT and TMS.  I don't understand why I should keep going.  I have completely fucked my life up.  Even in the best scenario I will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  I'll be barred from a ton of jobs that I was interested in.  I can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  I probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  I can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  I just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  My friends and family have abandoned me.  I was evicted when I was in jail and lost most of my stuff, I'm broke.  It just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  I feel like I have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  I am so fucking lonely but as much as I would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  What is the point?  Even if my life weren't a complete shit show I would still feel this way.  I just feel like I am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  This whole year has been like a nightmare that I can't wake up from.  Sometimes I wonder if I actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.  Losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  Why should I continue to wait around for that to happen?

"I am a deeply stupid person and I feel completely hopeless
For most of my life I've just been blissfully unaware. Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:

1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.
2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.
3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says ""VACANT."" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.
4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.
5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said ""I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love."" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.

These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so ashamed."| Risk
"I just feel trapped
Sorry if this feels all over the place, I'm just adding as I remember.
Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around."| Risk

Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing."| Risk

"The fear isn’t in dying. My fear is failing to commit suicide and the pain that I’ll feel as I try.
If I had a gun it would be easier, but my only options  all require pain. I just have to get past the pain part and I’ll be good to go.

Edit: I really don’t care for what comes after I die.  I just know that it’s better than dealing with what’s here for me. Trust me, I’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. I have no fear of being dead; I just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living.

Everything’s fine as long as you respond to 

their fucking messages.

If you say “I’m OK, it means you’re fine. 

If you say “I’m not feeling good” 

they’ll worry and then call another day

I'm worse than just all that though. Because im an airhead and I dont have good social skills. I'm always saying or doing something stupid. And it makes me more awkward. I act like it's all good and I'm happy and it doesnt phase me. But that is so far from the truth.

It pisses me off that when I go searching for information on how to kill myself effectively and without pain all I get are half assed 'don't kill yourself' pages. The internet used to be a source of knowledge and now it's just a bunch of fucking brands and shameless self promoting content creators and seeing it makes me want to kill myself even more.

I'm a fucking joke, I've been cheated on by everyone I've ever had a relationship with. She took out a credit card in my name and now I'm harassed every single day by people trying to get money from me. I'm in debt and I have no way out. She fucked this dude and now she's producer on his film. Can't wait for that to come out. I feel like everyone is laughing at me, the manlet cuck who got btfo.

I have intrusive thoughts about my genitals being mutilated all the time that cause me to physical wince, that is when I'm not literally spasming, probably from Parkinsons which runs in my family. I say shit out loud unconsciously like: ""Fucking kill myself"" and ""He killed himself"". I jerk myself awake at least once every night.

"Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea
How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

So let me get this straight: I never asked to be born, but I was.

I have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if I have doubts that I’ll ever be “happy.”

But I can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. They’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes. And all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside.

Edit: This is my first time posting here and I am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here. I hope to hear from more people. Please PM me or /u/ me in a comment if you’re interested in talking about something in particular (like someone mentioned OCD and intrusive thoughts)."| Risk

"I don't eat or sleep anymore and I hope it'll kill me.
As of writing this I have not slept for aprox 60 to 70 hours, have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me. But I resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

And while as the pathetic worthless low value man I am, I can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. To blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, I could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200B;

But here I am now hoping to perish. Eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. I don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact I feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

I can still think clearly, in fact that is what I wish I couldn't. I can think so clearly that I'm hoping to die even more.

While I write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that I've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200B;

Not eating have saved a great deal of money, I used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. Though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. My passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200B;

Leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. It has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

But that is not to be, I've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. And as I view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses I realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. I don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200B;

And meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that I might've finally went to sleep.

Hopefully to never wake up ever again.

I don't want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury.

"I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows
January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?"| Risk
"I called a hotline last week, now I owe thousands.
20m here. Tried overdosing last week but I still woke up. Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn't leave a suicide note that day. I probably won't ever leave a note when I go. Ideally, id just fade away."| Risk

"Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.
I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice.

The issue is when people use the stupid phrase “it gets better” as if it as definite event that is 100% going to occur, and it is highly offensive to me because I believed that as a kid, I believed that things just HAD to get better, but they haven’t. I’m aware that things CAN get better, just like things can get worse, but it’s not GOING to 100% get better because no one can really dictate that unless you can see into the future. Saying that shit just sets people up for disappointment , it’s a statement based on delusions and false hope.

The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too.

My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.
Edit: Still here. Going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision I think. Thank you for your kindness even if I don't understand it."| Risk
"Wife cheated update
Edit: So I've been getting a lot of DM's asking how I caught her etc and what I did. So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gt620f/wife_cheated/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂"| No risk;No risk
"My sister committed suicide last night.
The pain is so heavy in my heart right now. This whole time I thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. She was only 27. She lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. It’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. We have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. She was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. I have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. We have so many photos together. She always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays.

"I’m a Nurse who killed people
I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so."| Not defined

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement
We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

"[F17] - Feeling numb and lonely as fuck
Thanks to my fucking shyness and awkwardness I ended up being seen as a weird and retarted kid since my age of 6, when I started school. Parents were so worried about me they forced me to hang around with neighbours that didn't like me that at all. I was neglected and made fun off every since. I also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. Now I'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, I'm in a club, looking better... But scared of future and everything. I have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing I must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. I'm OK with family - but I never told them I want to kill myself. I plan to visit a Halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens I'm gonna overdose. I just wanna feel loved at once.
